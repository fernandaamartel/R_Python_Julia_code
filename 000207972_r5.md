# Report 5

This report includes information substracted from the article "Orchestrating Data/ML Workflows at Scale With Netflix Maestro"
The article seeks to introduce a new workflow orchestrator: _Maestro_, since its predecessor, _Meson_, started to show issues to support large-scaled workflows. 

After reading the article, we can highlight as the main strenght of it the detailed introduction of _Maestro_. Specially since it allows the reader to fully understand what it actually is and how it works. However, on the other hand, we find, as its weakness, to not encounter a section dedicated to the possible limitations this new workflow orchestrator may find in the future due to higher scale work and the issues that may arise with it.

When it comes to the article's contribution, it succeeds at pointing what _Maestro_ solves from _Meson_. For example, _Meson_ used to find traffic at certain hours, but _Maestro_ solves this issue when introducing its time-based schedulling service.

Finally, moving forward in this topic and question, it would be relevant to highlight what _Maestro_ keeps from _Meson_ as a learning, since we already understand what didn't work from the previous orchestrator. The introduction of _Meson's_ learnings would allow future developers to take that into account when working in new orchestrators apart from the both mentioned in this report.
