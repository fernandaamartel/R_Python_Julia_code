The following answers are based on Rezazadeh, Nikolenko and Rezaei’s article about Airbnb price prediction.
1.	The research question is the following: How can machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing techniques help property owners and consumers to predict a price for the asset when taking into considerations features such as both rental and owner characteristics and customer reviews.
2.	When it comes to strengths, first, the incorporation of a sentiment analysis through customer reviews allows the article considers important insight to develop a reliable predictive model. The article mentions the various models that were implemented to enhance the predictive model – Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, Neural Network, among others. On the opposite side, the weakness identified is the article doesn’t show an extensive discussion of the evaluation metrics to evaluate the model’s performance, therefore, the effectiveness is not clear. 
3.	The paper includes a paragraph dedicated to the contribution to future studies and what can these include. These works can include (i) the study of other selection schemed that may surge in the future, (ii) additional experimentation with neural net architectures and (iii) the addition of more training examples from other hospitality services.
4.	Adding external validation as a next step on new data from other hospitality services (not used on this article) to evaluate its generalizability would show the model’s performance through other properties price determination and its contribution to real world scenarios.
