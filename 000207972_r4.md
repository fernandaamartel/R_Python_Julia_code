# Report 4

This report is based on the article “Statistical Challenges in Online Controlled Experiments: A Review of A/B Testing Methodology” from Larsen, Stallrich, Sengupta, Deng, Kohavi and Stevens.

The paper explores statistical challenges encountered during online controlled experiments on online businesses. Their main focus is the A/B methodology. The article seeks to place current methodologies within their relevant statistical lineages to raise awareness on new research opportunities.

However, it’s important to highlight what is to be considered their main weakness: absence of empirical examples. The introduction of empirical examples throughout the paper can improve the applicability of this research and its impact on the real world, since it only debates theoretical challenges. On the other hand, its main strength is the doors it opens for collaboration between the academia and the online industry. Is highlights the importance of closing the gap between academic statisticians and the industry of interest. With this said, the contribution of the paper is to open conversation between academia and the industry to close methodological gaps in approaches and challenges while reviewing and extensive literature of current methodologies such as Heterogeneous Treatment Effects, Long Term Effects, among others. 

Finally, it would be important for the next steps of the investigation to discuss the ethical issues considering data privacy and user consent. Also, to address its weakness through the addition of empirical examples to show its real applicability.
