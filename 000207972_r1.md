Athey and Imbens succeed at exploring the importance of machine learning literature recent available when it comes to econometrics. Both authors seek to discuss the different goals and methods found in both machine learning literature and usual econometrics literature. Additionally, their main focus is around recent methods at the intersection of machine learning and econometrics that could perform better than the usual methods when applied to specific economic problems as causal inference.
I find two main strengths. First, they succeed at finding an intersection between Machine Learning and Econometrics while finding a bridge between both sciences. Second, the document references relevant and important literature. When it comes to the document’s weaknesses, I highlight the lack of “solution” to the fact that the field is constantly – and rapidly – evolving, making it harder to stay up to date with the knowledge and avoid it being outdated.
